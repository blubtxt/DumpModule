 
 Module Dumper is a small commandline Tool for Windows.
 It dumps a loaded Module ( .dll ) from the memory
 of a specified Process to a file on your Hardrive, 
 using WinAPI. 

 - Usage: DumpModule.exe ProcessName ModuleName DumpPath

 - Example: DumpModule.exe steam.exe Steam.dll C:\\test.dump 

 If you don`t refer a process name you get a process list, 
 the same with modules.
